//Compare the Java and Scala language

// Scala is a object oriented programming language as well as a functional programming language.But java is a general purpose object oriented programming.
// Scala support operator overloading but Java does not support operator overloading.
// Scala is not backward compatible but Java is backward compatible.
// Scala variables are by default immutable type. But Java variables are by default mutable type.
